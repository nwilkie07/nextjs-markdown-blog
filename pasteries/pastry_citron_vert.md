name: "Citron Vert avec Biscuit Noix de Coco"
rating: " I'm in Lime for more (8.0/10)"
rating2: "Lime Uh-Oh (7.0/10)"
seller: "Patisserie Mottier Vincent"
review: "A coconut and lime meringue with a green jello-like coating, and an extra burst of coconut in the center. You really need to like lime for this one as it's the dominant flavor, followed by sweet coconut notes. The biscuit crust is crumbly and lends a nice base."
