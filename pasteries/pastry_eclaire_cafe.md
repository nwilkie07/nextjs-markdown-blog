name: "Éclair au Café"
rating: "Eclair-rific (7.0/10)"
seller: "Patisserie Mottier Vincent"
review: "A delicious coffee-flavoured-cream-filled pastry. As far as eclairs go, this was a tasty treat, so long as you're a fan of coffee. However, the coffee flavouring did become a bit rich by the end, so make sure to eat it with a refreshing beverage."
