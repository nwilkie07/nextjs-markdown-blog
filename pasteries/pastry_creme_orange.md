name: "Crème à l'Orange"
rating: "Orange-tastic (8.5/10)"
seller: "Patisserie Mottier Vincent"
review: "A light, creamy treat with a nutty cake base, a flavourful orange coating, and a hazelnut chocolate centre. This confection is the perfect balance of light and sweet, especially if you’re a fan of cheesecake-like cakes and orange flavouring."
